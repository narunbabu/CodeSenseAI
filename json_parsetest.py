Players control a snake that grows longer as it consumes food items, while trying to avoid collisions with walls and itself. The game features score tracking, adjustable speed, and standard game controls (start, pause, reset).\n\n## Key Components\n- **HTML Structure**: Defines the game interface with canvas and controls\n- **CSS Styling**: Provides responsive, visually appealing design\n- **Game Logic**: JavaScript code handling core game mechanics\n- **User Interface**: Control buttons and displays for interacting with the game\n\n## Technologies Used\n- **HTML5**: Semantic markup and Canvas API for game rendering\n- **CSS3**: Modern styling with flexbox for responsive layout\n- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No external libraries, using requestAnimationFrame for game loop\n- **LocalStorage API**: For persisting high scores between sessions\n\n## Core Data Structures\n- **Snake**: Array of coordinates representing snake segments\n- **Food**: Object with x,y coordinates for food position\n- **Game State**: Object tracking current game status (running, paused, game over)\n- **Score**: Integer value updated as food is consumed\n\n## Information Flow\n1. User input (keyboard/buttons) â†’ Game state changes\n2. Game loop updates snake position and checks collisions\n3. Canvas rendering displays current game state\n4. UI updates show score and allow control adjustments\n\n## User Workflows\n- **Starting a game**: Click start button or press Enter key\n- **Controlling the snake**: Arrow keys or on-screen buttons\n- **Pausing/resuming**: Space bar or pause button\n- **Adjusting speed**: Slider control to make gameplay easier or more challenging\n- **Restarting after game over**: Reset button to start a new game\n\n## Areas for Improvement\n- Add mobile touch/swipe controls for better mobile experience\n- Implement different difficulty levels with obstacles\n- Add sound effects and background music\n- Create a multiplayer mode\n- Add power-ups for enhanced gameplay variety\n\n## Implementation Details\n- The game uses requestAnimationFrame for efficient animation\n- Collision detection is optimized to check only the snake's head against other objects\n- The speed control dynamically adjusts the game's difficulty without requiring a restart\n- Responsive design ensures playability across devices with different screen sizes"
